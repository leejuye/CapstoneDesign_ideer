# Magic Mirror sound level in vocal control [write in progress]

google-assistant SDK have native sound level control, we try to use it but it doesn't work :(

In order to get around this problem, we use the [MMM-Volume](https://github.com/eouia/MMM-Volume) module

### working commands: 
* volume [0 - 10]
* volume [0% - 100%]

### don't working commands:
* volume up
* volume down

**note: google assistant don't know what is actual sound level of the mirror**
